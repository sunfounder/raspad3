In the lower right corner of the Scratch, there are two areas-the character area and the stage area, where we can add the sprites and stage we want.

First the current sprite, and then click the **Choose a Sprite** button to add the sprite.

Here we need to find Monkey, click on it! You can use the search box above to find it. Here we give it a name **Harley**.

Harley is hungry. He asked his friend Perry where is the banana?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Click on your Harley sprite, and then click on the Event category. Drag „Äå**when ‚öë clicked**„Äç to the coding area on the right.

Click on the Looks category and drag „Äå**say "Hello!" for 2 second**„Äç to the bottom of "when ‚öë clicked".

Perry had seen bananas in the park, so he told Harley.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Perry is a Frog, add Frog sprite and Forest backdrop.

Click on the Frog sprite, add a 3 second „Äå**delay**„Äç block (wait for Harley to finish speaking), and then it speaks.

  :align: center

Now, click on the green flag, we can see Harley and Perry chat.

Harley went to the park and found bananas on the table.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now, click on the Backdrop and let it switch after 6 seconds (after the conversation ends).

.. image:: img/create_a_story9.png

  :align: center

Now, by clicking on the green flag, we can see that the Perry and Harley "come" to the park together after the conversation.

.. image:: img/create_a_story10.png
  :width: 600
  :align: center

But Harley should come to the park alone, and there should be bananas on the table. So, we have to make Perry "disappear".

Click on the Frog sprite, add an event, „Äå**when backdrop switches to...**„Äç, and find "hide" and "show" in Looks. Let the Perry appear at the right time!

.. image:: img/create_a_story11.png

Add the Banana sprite and adjust the angle.

.. image:: img/create_a_story12.png
  :width: 600
  :align: center

Also let it appear at the right time.

Now, click on the green flag and you can see a complete story.

Challenge
-----------

Believe that you who are smart will be able to program and implement this game soon, then we will add some challenges to enrich our story content.

- Harley will take the bananas back to the Forest, share it with Perry.
