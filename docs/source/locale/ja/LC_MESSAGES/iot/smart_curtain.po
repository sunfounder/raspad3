"In this project, we will simulate a scenario where the curtains are "
"automatically opened or closed according to the brightness of the room. "
"When the photoresistor detects that the room brightness is too bright, "
"Raspberry Pi will drive the motor to close the curtain; when the room "
"brightness is too dark, the curtain will be opened."

"Also you can view the indoor brightness change through text widget on "
"Cloud4RPi, or control the lamp with Switch widget (for electricity "
"safety, this experiment uses LED instead)."
