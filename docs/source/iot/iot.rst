IOT
================

The Internet of things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects—a.k.a. \"things\"—that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the Internet.

In this chapter, we will learn 2 different IoT platforms(Home Assistant and Cloud4RPi) to do some interesting IoT projects.

Home Assistant is a Python-based open source smart home system that supports smart home devices 
of many brands and can easily implement voice control and automation of the devices. 
You can run Home-assistant on the Raspberry Pi, without having to send your data out onto 
the internet. This means that you have total control over your data, 
limit the amount of internet traffic from your smart devices, and tighten up security.

Cloud4RPi is a cloud-based control panel for IoT projects. Cloud4RPi uses dashboard widgets to control IoT devices remotely and show real-time device data.
