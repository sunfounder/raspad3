Add Smart Devices
=================================

You can add your purchased smart devices to Home Assistant, such as smart sound, smart desk lamp, etc. You can also make your DIY device with ESP32 and add it in.

In this section, you will learn how to add your smart devices.

**1. Configure the Smart Device**

You need to make sure that your smart device has been assigned an IP. 
You can complete this step through the corresponding APP of the smart device. 
For example, the picture below shows a bedside lamp configured with **HomeKit**.
