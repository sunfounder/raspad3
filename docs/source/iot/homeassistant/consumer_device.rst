Add the Cunsumer Devices On HA
=================================

You need to make sure that your smart device has been assigned an IP. 
You can complete this step through the corresponding APP of the smart device. 
For example, the figure below shows the HomeKit configuration bedside lamp.

If Home Assistant finds a device on your network, it will display the corresponding integration, which can be easily added with just a few clicks. 
(If your smart device has not been discovered yet, donâ€™t worry, click the + button at the bottom right and search for your integration in the list.)

Each integration may be different in use, you can visit `Home Assistant Integration <https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/>`_ for details.


Return to the Overview page. If the device you just added does not appear, you need to Edit Dashboard.
