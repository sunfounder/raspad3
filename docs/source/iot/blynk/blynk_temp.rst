Temperature Recorder
====================

In this project, you can see the current temperature and the temperature change line graph from Blynk.

3. Create a Datastream for the Gauge widget (I used V5). It will be used to display the temperature. Set **DATA TYPE** to ``Double``, **DECIMALS** to ``#. #`` (two valid decimal places).

**3. Run the Code**

1. Edit the code

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block:: 

    cd /home/pi/blynk-raspberrypi-python
    sudo nano blynk_temp.py

2. Find the line below and past your ``BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN``.

.. code-block:: python

    BLYNK_AUTH = 'YourAuthToken'

3. Run the code.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block:: 

    sudo python3 blynk_temp.py

4. Go to Blynk. Now you can view the temperature and temperature change line graph on the Dashboard.
