GPIO Programming
====================

RasPad 3 can connect the 40 I/O pins of the Raspberry Pi to the breadboard, so you can use these pins to do some interesting projects. 

.. note::
  Before you start to experience the following courses, you need to refer to :ref:`GPIO Extension Board` to extend the 40 pins of the Raspberry Pi in RasPad to the breadboard.

SunFounder has a very complete course system about Raspberry Pi GPIO learning kits, such as the following two learning kits.

* :ref:`Electronic Kit for Raspberry Pi and Arduino`

A basic learning kit is suitable for Raspberry Pi and Arduino, in this kit you can learn basic circuit and programming knowledge.

* :ref:`Da Vinci Kit for Raspberry Pi`

This is an advanced Raspberry Pi learning kit that contains almost all types of components. You can learn the principles and perfect codes of all components.
