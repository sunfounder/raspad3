Precautions about the maintenance of lithium batteries
-----------------------------------------------------------------

* Lithium batteries can be stored in a clean, dry, and ventilated room with an ambient temperature of -5°C—35°C and a relative humidity of not more than 75%. Avoid contact with corrosive substances and keep away from fire and heat sources.

* Do not store the lithium battery with full charge for a long time. After long-term storage, it will easily cause swelling, which will affect the discharge performance. The best storage voltage is about 3.8V for a single chip. Fully charge before use and then use it, which can effectively avoid battery swelling.
