Scratch Projects
=================

In this chapter, you will learn to use Scratch on RasPad 3, which includes 10 examples.

If you are a user who has just used Scratch, we recommend that you try the teaching examples in order so that you can quickly get started with Scratch.


If the Raspberry Pi system you downloaded comes with recommended software, you can find Scratch 3 in **Programming**.

If you download a system with only a desktop, you can click **Preferences** -> **Recommended Software** -> **Programming** to install the Scratch 3 on RasPad 3.
