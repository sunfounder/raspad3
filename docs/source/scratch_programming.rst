Scratch project
=================

In this chapter, you will learn to use Scratch on RasPad 3, which includes 8 teaching examples and 2 practical examples.

If you are a user who has just used Scratch, we recommend that you try the teaching examples in order so that you can quickly get started with Scratch. When you have a certain understanding of Scratch and Raspberry Pi, you can try practical examples.


If the Raspberry Pi system you downloaded comes with recommended software, you can find Scratch 3 in **Programming**.

If you download a system with only a desktop, you can click **Preferences** -> **Recommended Software** -> **Programming** to install the Scratch 3 on RasPad 3.
