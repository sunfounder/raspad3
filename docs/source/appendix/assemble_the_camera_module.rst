Assemble the Camera Module
==================================

Open the back cover of the RasPad. Connect the FFC cable to the CSI interface of the Camera Module. Carefully pass the CSI interface cable through the slot on the back cover of the RasPad. Connect the CSI interface of the Raspberry Pi. Then carefully close the back cover of the RasPad.


.. warning::
  
  The SD card slot is a snap-in style attached to the back cover. Before removing or replacing the back cover, remove the micro-SD card to avoid damaging the micro-SD card and the RasPad's internal button board.
