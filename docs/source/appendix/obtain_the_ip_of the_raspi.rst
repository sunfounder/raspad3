After the Raspberry Pi is connected to WIFI, we need to get the IP address of it. There are many ways to know the IP address, and two of them are listed as follows.

**1. Checking via the router**

Check the addresses assigned to Raspberry Pi on the administration interface of the router.

The default hostname of the Raspberry Pi OS is raspberrypi. If you are using an ArchLinuxARM system, please find alarmpi.

**2. Network Segment Scanning**
   
Network scanning applications can be used to look up the IP address of Raspberry Pi, such as Advanced IP Scanner.

Scan the IP range set, and the names of all connected devices will be displayed. The default hostname of the Raspberry Pi OS is raspberrypi.
