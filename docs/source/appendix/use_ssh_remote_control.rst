Use the SSH Remote Control
===============================

Bash is the standard default shell of Linux, and can be opened on the Raspberry Pi by using SSH. The Shell itself is a program written in C programming language that acts as a bridge linking the customers and Unix/Linux systems.

**For Linux or/Mac OS X Users**

Go to **Applications** -> **Utilities**, find the **Terminal**, and open it.

Type in ``ssh pi@ip_address`` where ``pi`` is the username and ``ip_address`` is the IP address of the Raspberry Pi. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    ssh pi@192.168.18.197 

At the prompt, type ``yes`` in lowercase.

The default password is raspberry.

.. note::
  
  The characters do not display when typing in the password. Make sure to input the correct password.

**For Windows Users**

Windows users can use SSH with the PuTTY application.

Download PuTTY, open the application, and click Session on the left of the tree-like structure. Enter the IP address of the Raspberry Pi in the text box under Host Name, and enter 22 under Port.

Click Open.

.. note::
  
  When first logging in to the Raspberry Pi with the IP address, there will be a security prompt. Click Yes to continue.

When the PuTTY window prompts **login as:**, type in ``pi`` for the user name of the Raspberry Pi. The default password is ``raspberry``.

.. note:: 

  The characters do not display when typing in the password. Make sure to input the correct password.
