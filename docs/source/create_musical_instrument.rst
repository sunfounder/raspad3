- Input the button value from the GPIO pins.

Lesson Guide
--------------

Build the Circuit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First connect the GPIO Extension Board, please read :ref:`GPIO Extension Board` for specific steps.

.. warning::
  
  The card slot is set on the back cover and it’s in snap style. Therefore before opening or closing the back cover, you need to take out the microSD card to avoid damaging your microSD card and the internal button board.

On the left of Scratch 3 main page are some neatly arranged blocks with which you can drag to program. In this project, we need to add in other two functions: Music and Raspberry Pi GPIO. The Music function to play instruments and drums, and the Raspberry Pi GPIO function can be used to control the whole pins of Raspberry Pi.
