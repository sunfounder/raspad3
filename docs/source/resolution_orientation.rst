CHANGING SCREEN RESOLUTION OR ORIENTATION
===========================================

When you insert an SD card with the operating system already installed into your Raspberry Pi, and power on the display, the desktop should appear on the screen by default.

The latest Raspberry Pi OS (Bookworm and later) comes with several useful features, including a virtual on-screen keyboard and the ability to long-press for context menus. These features are ready to use without additional setup.

In addition to these enhancements, you can customize the screen by adjusting the resolution or changing the screen orientation to suit your needs.

Let's explore how to perform these tasks step by step.

Using an On-Screen Keyboard
-------------------------------------

Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm and later include the **Squeekboard** on-screen keyboard by default. This keyboard automatically appears when text input is needed and hides when it's not. For applications that do not support text entry detection, you can manually toggle the keyboard by clicking the keyboard icon at the right end of the taskbar.

Alternatively, you can configure the on-screen keyboard to always show or hide via the **Display** tab in **Raspberry Pi Configuration** or the **Display** section of ``raspi-config``.

.. note::

    If you are using a version of Raspberry Pi OS prior to Bookworm, use **matchbox-keyboard** as the on-screen keyboard. For the Wayfire desktop compositor, use ``wvkbd`` instead.

Setting the Screen Resolution
-------------------------------------

1. Click the **Raspberry Pi icon** -> **Preferences** -> **Screen Configuration**.

If you need to physically rotate the screen or mount it in a specific position:

1. Click the **Raspberry Pi icon** -> **Preferences** -> **Screen Configuration**.
