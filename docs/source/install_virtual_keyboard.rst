Install Virtual Keyboard on RasPad
========================================

When you use a touch panel such as RasPad, you can connect an external keyboard to help you do a text input operation, but it is best to install a virtual keyboard.

Install the required software with the following command.

.. raw:: html

    <run></run>

.. code-block:: shell

  sudo apt install onboard -y
  sudo apt install at-spi2-core

In order to make the virtual keyboard have a better effect, you need to do further settings.

Click the Raspberry Pi icon in the upper left corner and select **Preferences** -> **Onboard Settings**.
