Install Other Systems on RasPad
====================================

In addition to the **Raspberry Pi OS**, and RetroPie Operating system that we used before, RasPad 3 also supports other operating systems. 

Here we only provide a link for learning reference. You can try it again according to the operation steps above the link.

.. note::
    
    We have only tested Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu MATE, RetroPie on RasPad. If you flash other systems, but due to the imperfect design of these systems, some functions cannot be used. We can only recommend that you consult the developers of that system.
