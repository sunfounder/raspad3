Install Other Systems on RasPad
====================================

In addition to the **Raspberry Pi OS**, and RetroPie Operating system that we used before, RasPad 3 also supports other operating systems. 

Here we only provide a link for learning reference. You can try it again according to the operation steps above the link.

.. note::
    
    We have only tested Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu MATE , RetroPie on RasPad. If you have other systems installed, but some of them may have some bugs that make some of the functions unusable, we can only suggest you to consult the developer of that system.
